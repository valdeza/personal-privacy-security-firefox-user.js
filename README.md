# personal-privacy-security-firefox-user.js
_Brought to GitHub in hopes of tracking source changes easier._

Personal: Might contain personal edits for my own convenience at the expense of...  
Privacy/Security: With no real intention of "blending in".  
Firefox user.js: This is a user preferences file!

## How to Use

1. Go to page "about:support"
2. Under "Application Basics", click the "Show Folder" button next to "Profile Folder".
3. Copy/Move this user.js file to the resulting directory.
4. Restart Firefox.
5. Return to page "about:support"
6. Confirm the file has been installed correctly by examining the following sections:
  1. Important Modified Preferences: There should be a lot of new entries that correspond to lines from this file.
  2. user.js Preferences: This section might not have existed before, but now does.
